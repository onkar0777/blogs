# The Elder Program

Similar to what has been called a soul in spirituality, to me as a developr it feels like a deep rooted sub-routine which I am calling **The Elder Program**

The Elder Program is similar to the unconscious functions which keep the body alive but it is different in the way that on deeper understanding of your thoughts it can be understood.

It is this deep down program which makes us human, it is so untangible that it can just be experienced.

I am calling it the Elder Program because form me it has taken this shape of an elder brother, almost like an ancestor brother who is always there guiding my subconscious.

In the software analogy, I'll be the software which is running and I can identify myself very clearly, what thoughts are mine and why but the Elder Program is part of the OS which when I am running is part of me but still at some level separate from me and deeper. All my shiny features are mine and encapsulated within me and I can identify them but then there are parts of me which are coming from the Elder Program as well which feel separately designed from all other features.

I am hopeful that through meditation I should be able to access it more and eventually share more!
